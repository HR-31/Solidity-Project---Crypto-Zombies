### Solidity Project---Crypto Zombies

# Project Description:
CryptoZombies is an immersive, Ethereum-based gaming project that showcases an array of complex features and functionalities. Spanning six intensive levels, it delves into the intricacies of writing and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum network, organizing larger Solidity projects, optimising gas, leveraging payable functions, creating tradable tokens, and building user-facing decentralized applications.

# Motivation:
My motivation for undertaking the CryptoZombies project was to deepen my expertise in Solidity, Ethereum's smart contract programming language, and to explore the broader landscape of decentralized systems. Building games on the Ethereum network allowed me to interact with various components, offering a hands-on understanding of how blockchain technology can revolutionise the gaming industry.

# Technical Specifications:
Stack, Libraries and Tools: Solidity, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Web3.js, SafeMath library, MetaMask, Infura.
Components Scheme: The project is structured into six levels, each focusing on different aspects of Ethereum development.
Level 1: Writing Ethereum smart contracts and programming in Solidity.
Level 2: Basics of multiplayer gaming and interacting with other contracts on the Ethereum network.
Level 3: Securing contracts with contract ownership, building for gas optimisation and using function modifiers.
Level 4: Implementing payable functions and ensuring random number generation & security.
Level 5: Utilising tokens, ERC721 standard, Solidity libraries, and the SafeMath library.
Level 6: Utilising the Web3.js library, querying Ethereum nodes using JSON - RPC, and building web front-ends for smart contracts.

CryptoZombies provided an opportunity to experiment and innovate within the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing me to not only enhance my technical prowess but also explore the transformative potential of blockchain technology in contemporary gaming.
